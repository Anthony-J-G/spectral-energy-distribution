Submillimetre and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies: the
luminosity-temperature relation and consequences for photometric redshifts

aka hot glowy space dust

Paper Notes:


Abstract

	Properly measuring the spectral energy distributions of dusty, 
high redshift galaxies is important because it allows us to measure the luminosity
of said galaxies accurately. Knowing the luminosity has a lot of consequences like
allowing us to know more about their power source and also determining their 
redshift when there is spectroscopic information missing. The paper will look at
four different ways to fit the parameters. With respect to our project's goal, the
focus is only on light that exists within the infrared spectrum, touching briefly
on sub-infrared and far-infrared merely to analyze the degeneracy of the model.
